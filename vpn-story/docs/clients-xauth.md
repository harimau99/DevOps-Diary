# Configure IPsec/XAuth VPN Clients

*Read this in other languages: [English](clients-xauth.md), [简体中文](clients-xauth-zh.md).*

**Note: You may also connect using [IPsec/L2TP mode](clients.md), or set up [IKEv2](ikev2-howto.md).**

After <a href="https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn" target="_blank">setting up your own VPN server</a>, follow these steps to configure your devices. IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec") is natively supported by Android, iOS and OS X. There is no additional software to install. Windows users can use the free <a href="https://www.shrew.net/download/vpn" target="_blank">Shrew Soft client</a>. In case you are unable to connect, first check to make sure the VPN credentials were entered correctly.

IPsec/XAuth mode is also called "Cisco IPsec". This mode is generally **faster than** IPsec/L2TP with less overhead.
