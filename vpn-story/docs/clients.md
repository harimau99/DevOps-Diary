# Configure IPsec/L2TP VPN Clients

*Read this in other languages: [English](clients.md), [简体中文](clients-zh.md).*

**Note: You may also connect using the faster [IPsec/XAuth mode](clients-xauth.md), or set up [IKEv2](ikev2-howto.md).**

After <a href="https://github.com/hwdsl2/setup-ipsec-vpn" target="_blank">setting up your own VPN server</a>, follow these steps to configure your devices. IPsec/L2TP is natively supported by Android, iOS, OS X, and Windows. There is no additional software to install. Setup should only take a few minutes. In case you are unable to connect, first check to make sure the VPN credentials were entered correctly.

### Windows Error 809

> Error 809: The network connection between your computer and the VPN server could not be established because the remote server is not responding. This could be because one of the network devices (e.g, firewalls, NAT, routers, etc) between your computer and the remote server is not configured to allow VPN connections. Please contact your Administrator or your service provider to determine which device may be causing the problem.

To fix this error, a <a href="https://documentation.meraki.com/MX-Z/Client_VPN/Troubleshooting_Client_VPN#Windows_Error_809" target="_blank">one-time registry change</a> is required because the VPN server and/or client is behind NAT (e.g. home router). Download and import the `.reg` file below, or run the following from an <a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/open-elevated-command-prompt-windows/" target="_blank">elevated command prompt</a>. **You must reboot your PC when finished.**

- For Windows Vista, 7, 8.x and 10 ([download .reg file](https://static.ls20.com/reg-files/v1/Fix_VPN_Error_809_Windows_Vista_7_8_10_Reboot_Required.reg))

  ```console
  REG ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\PolicyAgent /v AssumeUDPEncapsulationContextOnSendRule /t REG_DWORD /d 0x2 /f

  ```

### Windows Error 628 or 766

> Error 628: The connection was terminated by the remote computer before it could be completed.

> Error 766: A certificate could not be found. Connections that use the L2TP protocol over IPSec require the installation of a machine certificate, also known as a computer certificate.

To fix these errors, please follow these steps:

1. Right-click on the wireless/network icon in your system tray.
1. Select **Open Network and Sharing Center**. Or, if using Windows 10 version 1709 or newer, select **Open Network & Internet settings**, then on the page that opens, click **Network and Sharing Center**.
1. On the left, click **Change adapter settings**. Right-click on the new VPN and choose **Properties**.
1. Click the **Security** tab. Select "Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol with IPsec (L2TP/IPSec)" for **Type of VPN**.

1. Click **OK** to save the VPN connection details.

![Select CHAP in VPN connection properties](images/vpn-properties.png)

### Windows 10 connecting

If using Windows 10 and the VPN is stuck on "connecting" for more than a few minutes, try these steps:

1. Right-click on the wireless/network icon in your system tray.
1. Select **Open Network & Internet settings**, then on the page that opens, click **VPN** on the left.
1. Select the new VPN entry, then click **Connect**. If prompted, enter `Your VPN Username` and `Password`, then click **OK**.

### Windows 10 upgrades

After upgrading Windows 10 version (e.g. from 1709 to 1803), you may need to re-apply the fix above for [Windows Error 809](#windows-error-809) and reboot.

### Windows 8/10 DNS leaks

Windows 8.x and 10 use "smart multi-homed name resolution" by default, which may cause "DNS leaks" when using the native IPsec VPN client if your DNS servers on the Internet adapter are from the local network segment. To fix, you may either <a href="https://www.neowin.net/news/guide-prevent-dns-leakage-while-using-a-vpn-on-windows-10-and-windows-8/" target="_blank">disable smart multi-homed name resolution</a>, or configure your Internet adapter to use DNS servers outside your local network (e.g. 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4). When finished, <a href="https://support.opendns.com/hc/en-us/articles/227988627-How-to-clear-the-DNS-Cache-" target="_blank">clear the DNS cache</a> and reboot your PC.

In addition, if your computer has IPv6 enabled, all IPv6 traffic (including DNS queries) will bypass the VPN. Learn how to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929852/guidance-for-configuring-ipv6-in-windows-for-advanced-users" target="_blank">disable IPv6</a> in Windows.

### macOS VPN traffic

OS X (macOS) users: If you can successfully connect using IPsec/L2TP mode, but your public IP does not show `Your VPN Server IP`, read the [OS X](#os-x) section above and complete this step: Click the **Advanced** button and make sure the **Send all traffic over VPN connection** checkbox is checked. Then re-connect the VPN.

### Android 6 and 7

If your Android 6.x or 7.x device cannot connect, try these steps:

1. Tap the "Settings" icon next to your VPN profile. Select "Show advanced options" and scroll down to the bottom. If the option "Backward compatible mode" exists (see image below), enable it and reconnect the VPN. If not, try the next step.
1. Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf` on the VPN server. Find the line `sha2-truncbug` and toggle its value. i.e. Replace `sha2-truncbug=no` with `sha2-truncbug=yes`, or replace `sha2-truncbug=yes` with `sha2-truncbug=no`. Save the file and run `service ipsec restart`. Then reconnect the VPN.

![Android VPN workaround](images/vpn-profile-Android.png)

### iOS 13 and macOS 10.15

If your iOS 13 or macOS 10.15 (Catalina) device cannot connect, try these steps: Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf` on the VPN server. Find `sha2-truncbug=yes` and replace it with `sha2-truncbug=no`. Save the file and run `service ipsec restart`. Then reconnect the VPN.

### iOS/Android sleep mode

To save battery, iOS devices (iPhone/iPad) will automatically disconnect Wi-Fi shortly after the screen turns off (sleep mode). As a result, the IPsec VPN disconnects. This behavior is <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/2333948" target="_blank">by design</a> and cannot be configured. If you need the VPN to auto-reconnect when the device wakes up, try <a href="https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install" target="_blank">OpenVPN</a> instead, which <a href="https://docs.openvpn.net/connecting/connecting-to-access-server-with-apple-ios/faq-regarding-openvpn-connect-ios/" target="_blank">has support for options</a> such as "Reconnect on Wakeup" and "Seamless Tunnel".

Android devices will also disconnect Wi-Fi shortly after entering sleep mode, unless the option "Keep Wi-Fi on during sleep" is enabled. This option is no longer available in Android 8 (Oreo). Alternatively, you may try enabling the "Always-on VPN" option to stay connected. Learn more <a href="https://support.google.com/android/answer/9089766?hl=en" target="_blank">here</a>.

### Debian 10 kernel

Debian 10 users: Run `uname -r` to check your server's Linux kernel version. If it contains the word "cloud", and `/dev/ppp` is missing, then the kernel lacks `ppp` support and cannot use IPsec/L2TP mode ([IPsec/XAuth mode](clients-xauth.md) is not affected).

To fix, you may switch to the standard Linux kernel by installing e.g. the `linux-image-amd64` package. Then update the default kernel in GRUB and reboot.

### Chromebook issues

Chromebook users: If you are unable to connect, try these steps: Edit `/etc/ipsec.conf` on the VPN server. Find the line `phase2alg=...` and append `,aes_gcm-null` at the end. Save the file and run `service ipsec restart`.

### Access VPN server's subnet

If you wish to allow VPN clients to access the VPN server's subnet, you'll need to manually add IPTables rules after setting up the VPN server. For example, if the subnet is `192.168.0.0/24`:

```
# For IPsec/L2TP
iptables -I FORWARD 2 -i ppp+ -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD 2 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -o ppp+ -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

# For IPsec/XAuth ("Cisco IPsec")
iptables -I FORWARD 2 -s 192.168.43.0/24 -d 192.168.0.0/24 -j ACCEPT
iptables -I FORWARD 2 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -d 192.168.43.0/24 -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

To make these IPTables rules persist after reboot, you may add them to file `/etc/iptables.rules` and/or `/etc/iptables/rules.v4` (Ubuntu/Debian), or `/etc/sysconfig/iptables` (CentOS/RHEL).

* https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25245854/windows-8-1-gets-error-720-on-connect-vpn

### Additional steps

Please try these additional troubleshooting steps:

First, restart services on the VPN server:

```bash
service ipsec restart
service xl2tpd restart
```

If using Docker, run `docker restart ipsec-vpn-server`.

Then reboot your VPN client device, and retry the connection. If still unable to connect, try removing and recreating the VPN connection, by following the instructions in this document. Make sure that the VPN credentials are entered correctly.

Check the Libreswan (IPsec) and xl2tpd logs for errors:

```bash
# Ubuntu & Debian
grep pluto /var/log/auth.log
grep xl2tpd /var/log/syslog

# CentOS & RHEL
grep pluto /var/log/secure
grep xl2tpd /var/log/messages
```

Check status of the IPsec VPN server:

```bash
ipsec status
ipsec verify
```

Show current established VPN connections:

```bash
ipsec whack --trafficstatus
```

## Configure Linux VPN clients using the command line

Instructions below are based on [the work of Peter Sanford](https://gist.github.com/psanford/42c550a1a6ad3cb70b13e4aaa94ddb1c). Commands must be run as `root` on your VPN client.

To set up the VPN client, first install the following packages:

```bash
# Ubuntu & Debian
apt-get update
apt-get -y install strongswan xl2tpd

# CentOS & RHEL
yum -y install epel-release
yum --enablerepo=epel -y install strongswan xl2tpd

# Fedora
yum -y install strongswan xl2tpd
```

Create VPN variables (replace with actual values):

```bash
VPN_SERVER_IP='your_vpn_server_ip'
VPN_IPSEC_PSK='your_ipsec_pre_shared_key'
VPN_USER='your_vpn_username'
VPN_PASSWORD='your_vpn_password'
```

Configure strongSwan:

```bash
cat > /etc/ipsec.conf <<EOF
# ipsec.conf - strongSwan IPsec configuration file

# basic configuration

config setup
  # strictcrlpolicy=yes
  # uniqueids = no

# Add connections here.

ln -s /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/strongswan/ipsec.conf
ln -s /etc/ipsec.secrets /etc/strongswan/ipsec.secrets
```

Configure xl2tpd:

```bash
cat > /etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf <<EOF
[lac myvpn]
lns = $VPN_SERVER_IP
ppp debug = yes
pppoptfile = /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client

EOF

chmod 600 /etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client
```

The VPN client setup is now complete. Follow the steps below to connect.

**Note:** You must repeat all steps below every time you try to connect to the VPN.

Create xl2tpd control file:

```bash
mkdir -p /var/run/xl2tpd
touch /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
```

Restart services:

```bash
service strongswan restart
service xl2tpd restart
```

Start the IPsec connection:

```bash
# Ubuntu & Debian
ipsec up myvpn

# CentOS/RHEL & Fedora
strongswan up myvpn
```

Start the L2TP connection:

```bash
echo "c myvpn" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
```

Run `ifconfig` and check the output. You should now see a new interface `ppp0`.

Check your existing default route:

```bash
ip route
```

Find this line in the output: `default via X.X.X.X ...`. Write down this gateway IP for use in the two commands below.

Exclude your VPN server's IP from the new default route (replace with actual value):

```bash
route add YOUR_VPN_SERVER_IP gw X.X.X.X
```

If your VPN client is a remote server, you must also exclude your Local PC's public IP from the new default route, to prevent your SSH session from being disconnected (replace with <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=my+ip" target="_blank">actual value</a>):

```bash
route add YOUR_LOCAL_PC_PUBLIC_IP gw X.X.X.X
```

Add a new default route to start routing traffic via the VPN server：

```bash
route add default dev ppp0
```

The VPN connection is now complete. Verify that your traffic is being routed properly:

```bash
wget -qO- http://ipv4.icanhazip.com; echo
```

The above command should return `Your VPN Server IP`.

To stop routing traffic via the VPN server:

```bash
route del default dev ppp0
```

To disconnect:

```bash
# Ubuntu & Debian
echo "d myvpn" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
ipsec down myvpn

# CentOS/RHEL & Fedora
echo "d myvpn" > /var/run/xl2tpd/l2tp-control
strongswan down myvpn
```
