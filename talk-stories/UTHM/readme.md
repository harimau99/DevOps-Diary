# Talk : Cloud Computing is Nowadays Canvas

## Slides: 

## Brief

Whenever or Whereever we go. We see clouds in the sky that wave and move from one place to another. It provide cover for us from direct sunlight and help us from time to time. Sometimes, it will bring disaster along the way (due to the propagation of the material component between water and gas involve).


By looking at this. The same principle has been using in cloud computing. 

Looking at below similarities examples either by term, definition and how it relates:


|       Term/Item/Definition        |                   Effects                           |         In IT           | 
|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
|           Cloud                   |  Providing a platform and covers from <br/>direct sunlight and rain for earth | In IT, it provide platform instance or resource to communicate and serve |
|           Disaster                |   Issue that come after a component is made up into black cloud and also after long raining | If a configuration is has impurity either misconfigure and as well theres is a breaking storm in the pipeline it will not serve the concurrent user. Which leads to business and operation issue|
| Material Component & Involve      | When water is solidified in cloud , the particle is perform a blackcloud. The Deeper its color, more effect will come out | When you are misconfigure, issue like exploits or disparity that come out from this will effect the business and Data exploits |


By looking at this we know that it is no a child play and it is important to be good at it.

## Discipline in Cloud Computing

As the market demand grows.
